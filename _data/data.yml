    title: About me
    summary: |
      I am a graduate of the Poznań University of Technology. 
      I have a master's and engineering degree in Chemical and 
      Process Engineering at the Faculty of Chemical Technology. 
      I have always been passionate about chemistry and mathematics, 
      and this field of study combines these subjects well.
      Near the end of my studies, I had contact with some people 
      who work as programmers and they encouraged me to give it a try. 
      I started with learning Java and found it very interesting. 
      Enough so, that I decided to develop my skills further. 
      In the future, I hope to find a job that combines my 
      knowledge in both programming and chemistry in some way.

        link: https://github.com/Julaaaa/Memory-Test-Game
        tagline: I always liked playing the classic Memory game and decided to create the Memory Test Game as my spin-off version of it.
       The main goal is to memorize the positions of all of the numbers that appear on the board and then click them in ascending order. 
       The player can customize the game setting, and save his highest score within the app. The game was written in Android Studio using Java.
